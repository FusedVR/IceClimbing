Thanks for purchasing my rain particle systems set for Unity 3D!

If you haven’t already, import the package into your Unity 3D project by double clicking the .unitypackage file and then click the 'import' button. Make sure all files are selected, the demo scene can be un-ticked if you don’t want to make use of it.

Using the prefabs:

There are three strengths: soft, medium and heavy.

Each strength has the option of ground effects; use the ‘NoGround’ prefabs if you don’t want the rain to ripple when it hits the ground.

Each strength also has the option of using external forces (i.e. Wind Zones) to influence each particle. If you don’t want this use the ‘NoExternalForces’ prefab, or simply un-tick ‘External Forces’ in the inspector. You can still add sideways motion to your particles using the force over lifetime to give an impression of wind without having a Wind Zone.

All particle systems are editable. Enjoy!
